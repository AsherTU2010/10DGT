name = input("Hey, What is your name? ")

# Ask the user for two numbers and then add them together
num1 = int(input("What is your first number? "))
num2 = int(input("What is your second number? "))
print(f"You first number was {num1}")
print(f"You second number was {num2}")

# To check that the input was stored correctly
print(num1)
